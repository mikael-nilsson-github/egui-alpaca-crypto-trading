# egui-alpaca-crypto-trading

I'm new to Rust and egui/eframe and I'm rebuilding my previous trading platform written in C. So far I'm very impressed by Rust as well as how simple it is to get started with the egui/eframe library/framework.

This is a quick and dirty first attemp to a new graphical user interface for my machine learning and AI algorithms. I hope it may inspire you to get started with Rust and egui/eframe.

For rendering of candlestick charts as well as on demand repaint of the gui (idle otherwise), please see my other repositories.
